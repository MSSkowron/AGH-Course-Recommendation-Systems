# Recommendation_Systems_AGH_Course

This repository contains solutions for the Recommendation Systems course at AGH University of Science and Technology.

- [**L1: Basket analysis**](./L1-Basket_analysis/)

  Explore the use of basket analysis, a technique that harnesses customers' historical purchases to generate effective product recommendations.

- [**L2: Bandits**](./L2-Bandits/)

  Dive into diverse recommendation selection strategies using multi-armed bandit algorithms. Evaluate their effectiveness against optimal strategies and other naive approaches.

- [**L3: Segmentation**](./L3-Segmentation/)

  Delve into user segmentation based on beer preferences. Utilize beer review data to create embeddings representing users' tastes in a vector space. Cluster users, analyze beer style popularity within each segment, and visualize results using word clouds.

- [**L4: News**](./L4-News/)

  Focus on news portal recommendations using the Microsoft News Dataset. Process text, calculate similarity measures, and propose the k most similar news articles for a given one. Steps include text processing, Bag of Words matrix creation, transformation into a TF-IDF matrix, calculation of distances between news articles, and suggestion of the most similar articles.

- [**L5: Group Recommenders**](./L5-GroupRecommenders/)

  Address group recommendations within movie ratings using the MovieLens dataset. Compare different group recommendation algorithms, including simple algorithms (random, average ratings, and user-specific preferences), Proportional Approval Voting approximation algorithms, and objective functions focusing on user satisfaction metrics, overall group satisfaction, and group disagreement measures. Conduct a comparative analysis of algorithms in terms of average satisfaction and group disagreement.
