# Recommendation_Systems_AGH_Course

This repository contains solutions for the Recommendation Systems course at AGH University of Science and Technology.

- [**L1: Basket analysis**](./L1-Basket_analysis/)

  Basket analysis leverages customer's past purchases to generate effective product recommendations.

- [**L2: Bandits**](./L2-Bandits/)

  Explore diverse recommendation selection strategies using multi-armed bandit algorithms. Evaluate their effectiveness against optimal strategies and other naive approaches.

- [**L3: Segmentation**](./L3-Segmentation/)

  Dive into user segmentation based on beer preferences. Utilize beer review data to create embeddings, representing users' tastes in a vector space. Cluster users and analyze beer style popularity within each segment. Visualize results using word clouds highlighting key beer styles in each segment.

- [**L4: News**](./L4-News/)

  Focus on news portal recommendations using data from the Microsoft News Dataset. Process text, calculate similarity measures, and propose the k most similar news articles for a given one.

  - Text processing
  - Bag of Words matrix creation
  - Transformation into a TF-IDF matrix
  - Calculation of distances between news articles
  - Suggestion of the most similar articles

- [**L5: Group Recommenders**](./L5-GroupRecommenders/)

  Address group recommendations within movie ratings using the MovieLens dataset. Compare different group recommendation algorithms.

  - Simple algorithms (random, average ratings, and user-specific preferences)
  - Proportional Approval Voting approximation algorithms
  - Objective functions focusing on user satisfaction metrics, overall group satisfaction, and group disagreement measures.
  - Comparative analysis of algorithms in terms of average satisfaction and group disagreement.
